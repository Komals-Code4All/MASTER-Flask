# Harvard CS50 Hour 3

This hour looks at implementing cookies.

Each user session will have its own session cookie and can hold various variables as required, e.g. current user  login-id and shopping-cart.

<code>pip install flask_session</code>


## Flask20 Implement Flask login/lout with session cookie

## Flask21 Implement shopping basket cookie
    This needs a SQL database
    You will need some products table, e.g. Books, which can be added to the shopping cart.

## Flask 22 Implement a database search webpage
